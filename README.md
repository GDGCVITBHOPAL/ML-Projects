### Handwritten Digit Classification

> Built using the MNIST Dataset, this project explores both ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) approaches to recognize handwritten digits. <br>
> This is a beginner level project to learn Deep Learning.<br>
> Inspired from [Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview) , CNN performed better and Results 
> can be seen below:
